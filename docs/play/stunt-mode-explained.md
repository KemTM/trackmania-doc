# Stunt mode explained

## The concept
The mode is all about excuting perfect stunts - jumps, flips, corkscrews and 360 noscopes. The longer you are in the air, the more you spin, the more wicked the trick is, the more points per stunt you are awarded. How those points are altered and accumulated to produce your final score depend on a few different factors.

## Multipliers
There are 3 different multiplier levels available:
- <:bronze:736340629939945483> Perfect - 1.5x
- <:silver:736340630216900670> Master - 2.0x
- <:gold:736340629864579103> Epic - 2.5x

These multipliers represent how well you have executed a certain stunt and **are applied to the following stunt's score**.
Perfect stunts simply require a clean/flat landing that has the car facing right about forwards or backwards compared to the direction it is heading. Sideways landings, no matter how perfectly flat they are, don't count.
Master and Epic stunts involve the concept of "air control", which essentially means any _change_ of your inputs mid-air. If you land perfectly as described above without making any input changes (aka not doing any air control) for the last 1 second of the stunt you are awarded the Master tier and if you manage to maintain the same inputs for the last 3 seconds of the stunt, you are awarded the Epic tier. Note, that you can still change the inputs early in the stunt, only the last few seconds before landing count. Also, you cannot achieve Master/Epic tier from a basic straight jump, you have to try harder than that ðŸ˜›
To help you see, whether your stunt is potentially Perfect, Master or Epic, there are colored trails being emitted from the back of the car throughout the stunt. No trails means potentially Perfect, dim trails means Master and bright trails means Epic, assuming you nail the landing. You can actually see this progression on longer jumps if you keep holding the inputs for longer.
Once you have achieved the certain tier of a stunt, its multiplier has no time limit and will be applied whenever you complete the next stunt. This system in theory encourages you to find a set of stunts, where chaining them one after another gains the most amount of points.

## Stunt park segments
So how do you actually secure those points? This is where stunt parks come in. Each Stunts map may have 0 and up to 5 (one per color) stunt park segments. Each segment is _activated_ by crossing its corresponding checkpoint. Note that there could be multiple linked checkpoints activating the same segment from different places of the map, giving you the choice where and how to start your stunt sequence!
Whenever a segment is activated, a 10 second timer starts, denoted by the progress bar up top of the screen and also a colored overlay/vignette. While that timer is active, all performed stunts contribute their points to the overall park/segment score. To not penalize longer/higher stunts, the timer is paused while the car is mid-air, meaning that you should probably try to minimize your time on the ground to maximize your score on the leaderboard ðŸ˜‰
Once the timer runs out, that's it - either move on to the next segment or hit respawn and retry the current one again.

## Securing your final score
In theory, each segment can be retried an infinite amount of times, either by respawning at the last park's checkpoint or hitting delete altogether to begin from the start again, **without losing your points**. This is a grindy gamemode with no time limit, if you have 4 hours in your day, you can spend those hours trying to maximize your session's score.
Only when you cross the finish line, the session is ended and the points are locked in. Your final score will be the sum of all individual segement scores + your best stunt score overall, no matter if it was performed during an active stunt park sequence or not.
In the end, all players are ranked by their accumulated stunts score.
